# Paris_homes_analysis
A python analysis using Machine-Learning models in order to predict homes prices in Paris

In this project, the goal is to analyze various aspects of homes in Paris using Python and machine learning models. By utilizing data-driven approaches, we aim to draw insightful conclusions about the real estate market in Paris.

Objectives The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Data Collection: Gather relevant data about homes in Paris, including features like location, size, number of bedrooms, amenities, and sale/rent prices.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data, handling missing values, outliers, and data formatting issues.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of different features within the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Extract and create meaningful features that can enhance the predictive power of the models.

Model Building: Develop machine learning models (e.g., regression, clustering, etc.) to predict home prices, identify patterns, and segment the real estate market.

Conclusions: Draw actionable conclusions from the analysis to provide insights into the factors influencing home prices, popular neighborhoods, and potential investment opportunities.

Methodology Data Collection: Utilize web scraping tools or publicly available datasets to collect information about homes in Paris, including attributes such as location, size, amenities, and prices.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring consistency in data formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Create visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, etc.) to understand the distribution of features, correlations between variables, and identify any notable trends.

Feature Engineering: Generate new features such as price per square meter, proximity to key landmarks, or a property score based on amenities.

Model Building: Employ machine learning models like linear regression, random forests, or clustering algorithms to predict prices and segment the market.

Conclusions: Based on the analysis, draw conclusions about the most influential features affecting home prices, identify neighborhoods with high demand, and suggest potential investment opportunities.

Key Findings Location Impact: The analysis highlights that proximity to landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower or Louvre Museum significantly impacts property prices.

Amenities Influence: Homes with specific amenities like balconies, garden access, or modern appliances tend to have higher market values.

Neighborhood Segmentation: Clustering analysis reveals distinct segments within the market, helping buyers and investors target their preferences effectively.

Price Prediction: The developed regression model achieves a predictive accuracy of X%, aiding in estimating property prices more accurately.

Conclusion By combining data analysis techniques and machine learning models, this project sheds light on the factors influencing home prices in Paris. The insights gained from this analysis can guide homebuyers, real estate professionals, and investors in making informed decisions.
